# arm-swinger

A component for moving an entity based upon arm movement. The direction of travel is determined by the forward direction of the arm movement, and the speed by the speed of arm movement

e.g.
<a-entity id="cameraRig" arm-swinger="left: #leftHand; right: #rightHand; startEvent: trackpaddown; endEvent: trackpadup; scaling: .3">
  <a-camera id="camera"></a-camera>
  <a-entity id="leftHand" vive-controls="hand: left"></a-entity>
  <a-entity id="rightHand" vive-controls="hand: right"></a-entity>
</a-entity>
