# uv-transform

Wraps the threejs texture uvTransform logic, providing functionality to set the offset, repeat and rotation of a texture.  The transform is applied to the alphaMap, bumpMap, displacementMap, emissiveMap, map, metalnessMap, normalMap, and roughnessMap (if they exist).

Note that 0,0 represents the bottom left of the texture and 1,1 is the top right.

e.g.
```html
<a-entity material="src: url(image.jpg)" uv-transform="offset: .2 .2; rotation: 95; repeat: 1.5 1.5">
```
Applies an offset of `.2 .2`, rotation of `95` degrees (centered around the default of `.5 .5`) repeating the pattern `1.5 1.5` times.

This component can appear multiple times on the same instance (typically for different meshes)

## Properties
**frame**: number = `0`

The frame to show (starting from 0).  The frame dimensions are set in **textureFrame**, and frame 0 represents the top leftmost frame, with frames numbered sequentially left to right, then continuing from the leftmost frame of the next row

---
**maps**: string = `map`

A comma separated list of threejs material map types to apply this transform to search https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/materials/MeshStandardMaterial for a list of potential maps

---
**meshName**: string = `mesh`

Name of the mesh to apply the transform to

---
**offset**: vec2 = `0 0`

Offset in UV coords for translating this texture

---
**pivot**: vec2 = `.5 .5`

The pivot in UV coords about which this texture is rotated

---
**repeat**: vec2 = `1 1`

Number of times to repeat this texture

---
**rotate**: number = `0`

Angle in degrees to rotate this texture about the **pivot**.  Positive numbers represent anti-clockwise rotations

---
**textureFrame**: vec2 = `1 1`

The frame dimensions of this texture. `1 1` indicates that there is only a single frame, frame 0. `4 8` would be 4 frames wide and 8 frames high

---
**wrapS**: `repeat` | `clampToEdge` | `mirroredRepeat` = `repeat`

Defines the method for continuing the texture in the **u** dimension beyond 0 or 1 by either: repeating it; clamping it to 0,1; or mirroring it

----
**wrapT**: `repeat` | `clampToEdge` | `mirroredRepeat` = `repeat`

Defines the method for continuing the texture in the **v** dimension beyond 0 or 1 by either: repeating it; clamping it to 0,1; or mirroring it
