## wait-add-remove

Removes and Adds entities to this entity after an event and/or a delay.  Removes occur before Adds.  The **add** property is an array of selector definitions that represent entities to add

This component can appear multiple times on a single entity

e.g.
```html
<a-entity wait-add-remove="delay: 10; add: a-entity.class#id[geometry=primitive: box][material.color=red]; 
  remove: #three,[color=blue]"></a-entity>
```
after `10` seconds, removes all descendants with the id `three` or an attribute `color` of `blue`, then add a child entity of type `a-entity` with a classname `class`, an id of `id` and two attributes `geometry="primitive: box"` and `material="color:red"`

```html
<a-entity wait-add-remove="event: click; source: .button; sourceScope: self; delay: 2.5; 
  add: a-box#mybox[color=blue]"></a-entity>
```
once the `click` event is received from child of this component (`sourceScope: self`) matching the selector `.button`, wait 2.5 seconds, then add an `a-box` with id `mybox` and `color="blue"`
